# Arrays in C

This folder contains C programs that focus on the fundamental and practical use of arrays.  
Arrays are one of the most important data structures in C, as they allow efficient storage, access, and manipulation of multiple values of the same data type using a single variable name.

The programs in this folder are written to strengthen both conceptual understanding and logical problem-solving skills related to arrays.

## Topics Covered

### One-Dimensional Arrays
Basic operations on one-dimensional arrays are implemented to understand how data is stored and accessed using indices.

### Two-Dimensional Arrays
Programs using two-dimensional arrays demonstrate matrix-like data representation and operations. These examples help in understanding nested loops and row–column based access.

### Finding Minimum and Maximum Elements
This section includes programs to identify the minimum and maximum values present in an array. These problems focus on traversal techniques and comparison logic.

### Binary Search
Binary search is implemented to efficiently locate an element in a sorted array. This program highlights the importance of sorting and demonstrates a divide-and-conquer approach.

### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is used to sort array elements in ascending order. Although simple, this algorithm helps in understanding basic sorting logic and iterative comparisons.

## Purpose of This Folder

The aim of these programs is to:
- Build a strong foundation in array manipulation
- Improve familiarity with loops and conditional statements
- Practice commonly asked problems in academics and interviews
- Develop structured and readable C programs

Each program in this folder focuses on one concept and is written for clarity and learning rather than optimization.
